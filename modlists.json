Fully voiced main character (can turn off), survival gameplay (can turn off), Landscapes change drastically depending on the season keeping every playthrough fresh. Combat has been rebuilt from the ground up with modern mechanics, animations (BFCO) and AI. Every notable questline has been expanded to provide more role playing opportunities. Hours of new content. Highly immersive, reactive world that never drops below 60 FPS (minimum requirement of 6 GB of Vram).",
