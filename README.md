# True-North

[👶 IMPORTANT INFO FOR NEW PLAYERS]

NO STOCK GAME FOLDER!
What does that mean?: 

You need the latest v1.70 of Skyrim Anniversary Edition and all Creation Club content that came with it. (GOG version has not been tested, I don't own a copy but should work fine) 

Your game folder cannot have e.g., SKSE, Engine Fixes, or ENB .dll files added to it (remove them if you have them) 

ESPs cleaned with SSEEdit are fine and recommended.

Widscreen, Controller and gamepad are supported.
(Select the Widescreen or Widescreen-performance profile in MO2)

initial installation REQUIRES 175 GB. after which you can delete everything in the True North Downloads folder to bring the file size down to 115 GB

Recommended tweaks:

Survival Mode is enabled by default, which also disables fast travel. To compensate, Carriage Ferry Travel Overhaul and Road Signs Fast Travel 
are added—more carriage drivers appear, and activating a road sign lets you fast travel to any town listed on it. (disable survival mode improved mod or visit the main menu game settings to turn off survival mode)

Choose your character’s voice in the DBVO MCM menu (options available for both male and female voices).

On starting a new game, the world begins at a random point in the seasonal cycle (it might be winter or summer).
To change this, open MCM Recorder → Default Settings, "delete the 0023_$SS_ModName" file (first one), then start the game and open the Select Your Season MCM menu — available briefly for new characters

[True North]

True North is my vision of Skyrim —a wabbajack list of 1000+ mods. A celebration of the Skyrim modding community’s incredible work over the last 14+ years.

[⚒️ Modding, Simplified]

Modding Skyrim in 2025 is no easy task. To get the best possible experience, you need to master countless tools — xEdit, DynDOLOD, xLODGen, Grass Cache, Creation Kit, Pandora, Synthesis, Wrye Bash, Bodyslide (the list goes on and on). Let me handle all of that for you.

The list automatically configures itself — no manual setup is needed in game.

[🗺️ The Vision]

True North stays faithful to Skyrim’s original design while enhancing it in every meaningful way.

Roleplaying is the heart of the experience. Alternate start lets you choose your own beggining and every notable questline has been altered to provide more roleplaying opportunitys. 

Experience your character fully voiced — with both male and female voice options that bring every line, shout, and choice to life. (Open MCM Menu and select a voice in the DBVO menu panel

Survival is fully integrated — not as a punishment, but as a way to slow down, breathe, and truly live in the handcrafted world. (Turn off survival by disabling survival mode improved if surival is not your thing) 

[🌍 A Living, Breathing Skyrim]

Seasons of Skyrim Integration — experience the world transform as winter arrives, draping the all holds in a stunning blanket of snow. 

Dynamic world events — Thanks to SRC: Conquering of Skyrim, clearing a bandit fort means guards from the local hold will move in to reclaim it.

Persistent world changes — Solve the mystery of a burned-down house and watch it be rebuilt later. Clear a monster-infested mine and return to see the nearby town thriving again. 
See the scars of the Civil War slowly heal over time. (and much more)

[Mods I Created 🎨]

Love is in the air ❤️ - NPCs naturally fall in love, marry, move in together, and hold real weddings you'll be invited to  attend if you’re friends; (can change in the mod file ini settings)

Hail ❄️ — Experience intense weather where NPCs react naturally, running for cover as hailstorms roll in. (In game menu Press f1)

Lightning Rod ⚡ — Npcs holding Metal weapons can get hit by lighting during storms. Risk increases at higher altitudes or in water. (Can change in MCM settings)

[⚔️ Combat]

Vanilla Skyrim’s third-person combat suffers from “ice skating,” with attacks feeling weightless. True North replaces this with a grounded step & swing system using the latest and greatest combat framework BFCO. dodging and timed blocking has been added and First-person combat has also been fully overhauled with the same attention to detail. 

Combat is further elevated by four key combat overhauls:

Precision — brings true physics-based melee, realistic collisions, hit reactions, and weapon feedback.

Dismemberment Framework — adds real-time dismemberment, adaptive sound effects, and blood physics for visceral realism.

Sanguine Symphony — enhances combat with with brutal visual effects like adaptive blood splatters, detailed decals, HD wound textures, and custom sound design.

NPC Spell Variance — reworks NPC spell logic so mages use their full arsenal, including support, utility, and rune spells. No more mindless fireball spam — enemies now think, adapt, and fight with real strategy.

[📜 Quests]

Every notable questline has been overhauled to provide more choice and freedom but here are some new quests/content you might want to check out:

☠️ Olenveld

Summary: Explore the lore-rich island of Olenveld — a full DLC-sized new land with unique quests and an island recapturing system.

The topic will only appear after you progress in the Main Story to the point where the Blades have moved into Sky Haven Temple (i.e. complete the quest "Alduin's Wall"). Link: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136788

[👥 NPCs]

NPCs now react to danger and the weather, and respond dynamically to events. Strangers won’t automatically greet you, and with my mod Love Is In The Air, NPCs can meet, fall in love, marry, move in together, and even invite you to their weddings if your friends — adding real social life and emotion to Skyrim.

Visual overhauls bring every NPC to life with a new look thanks to a selection of appearence overhaul mods handpicked from the most talented creators, while preserving the rugged, look appropriate for those living in skyrims harsh climate.

Most vanilla npc followers have been greatly expanded with the "follower dialogue expansion" series to ensure using your old favourite followers feels fresh again. 

My favourite follower creater Craftian's followers can also be found in this list:

Celestine - A devout follower of stendarr found in front of the Jade Palace.

Nessa - A thief whos lost her arm during her last heist. She can be found in Rorikstead inn

Light and Shade - a blind travelling mercenary with a charming curiosity. She can be found in Whiterun Banneredmare inn. 

Every faction has been reimagined:

Madmen transforms the Forsworn, giving them a unique identity, shamanistic powers, and even rare werewolf transformations.

The Restless Dead breathes new life into Skyrim’s undead, introducing diverse draugr, skeletons, and ghosts with unique tactics and visual variety. Every dungeon populated by the undead now offers new boss encounters.

Lawless overhauls bandits across Skyrim and Solstheim, adding new archetypes, scalable levels, and varied combat styles — ensuring every bandit encounter is challenging and fresh. 

Vigilants have been given ALOT of love with brand new equipment and a mod added allowing you to rebuild the hall of the vigilants afer its destroyed after level 10. (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49346)

Silverhand now has a new set of gear and is no longer hostile to the player for no reason. You can find out a bit of their story and might even become a honorary member. Silverhand will only become hostile if you join the Companions and become a werewolf.

[📈 Performance]

True North delivers a next-gen experience without compromising performance. On a system with an NVIDIA RTX 4060 8GB gpu and Intel i7-13700KF cpu, True North maintains 60 FPS across all areas. With experience as an SKSE developer, rest assured I’ve carefully optimized the modlist to run smooth even on older machines. 

Should you still encounter fps drops, try switching ti the performance profile in Mod Organize 2 by selecting the ID card icon in the task bar.

[🏔️ Conclusion]

Im from northern Canada and skyrim reminds me of home. The northern lights especiialy which I can view form my front porch. 

I made this modlist for myself, to play the modded version of Skyrim I’ve always dreamed of  — and now its available for everyone else.  

Enjoy : )
