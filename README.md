# True-North


[IMPORTANT INFO FOR NEW PLAYERS]

NO STOCK GAME FOLDER!
What does that mean?: It means you need to have a clean install of skyrim already on your computer. 

A clean install means the game files haven’t been modified — for example, no SKSE, Engine Fixes, or ENB files added. However, ESPs cleaned with SSEEdit are perfectly fine.
thanks to root buidler I left out a stockgame folder to save space  and to provide support for users who bought skyrim of gog or other locations. 
MO2 should automatically detect your copy of skyrim but if it does not you might have to point it to your skyrim.exe manually.

Steam version is prefferable The GOG version has not been tested and may not be work im not sure. 

Widescreens have not been tested and are not supported currently. Controller and gamepad should work fine.

Anniversary Edition content is required.

After Wabbajack finishes installing, delete all files in the Downloads folder to free up space (over 50GB).

The list automatically configures itself — no manual setup is needed in game.



Recommended tweaks:

Press Up arrow key to enable / disable camera preset

Survival Mode is enabled by default, which also disables fast travel. To compensate, Carriage Ferry Travel Overhaul and Road Signs Fast Travel 
are added—more carriage drivers appear, and activating a road sign lets you fast travel to any town listed on it.

Rebind the Power Attack key (default: V) via the BFCO MCM menu.
On starting a new game, the world begins at a random point in the seasonal cycle (it might be winter or summer).
To change this, open the Select Your Season MCM menu — available for a limited time after character creation.
Choose your character’s voice in the DBVO MCM menu (options available for both male and female voices).

[True North]

True North is my vision of Skyrim —a wabbajack list of 1000+ mods. A celebration of the Skyrim modding community’s incredible work over the last 14+ years.

[⚒️ Modding, Simplified]

Modding Skyrim in 2025 is no easy task. To get the best possible experience, you need to master countless tools — xEdit, DynDOLOD, xLODGen, Grass Cache, Creation Kit, Pandora, Synthesis, Wrye Bash (the list goes on and on). Let me handle all of that for you.

 NO ADDITIONAL SETUP REQUIRED PLUG AND PLAY.

[🗺️ The Vision]

True North stays faithful to Skyrim’s original design while enhancing it in every meaningful way.

Roleplaying is the heart of the experience. Alternate start lets you choose your own beggining and every notable questline has been altered to provide more roleplaying opportunitys. 

Experience your character fully voiced — with both male and female voice options that bring every line, shout, and choice to life. (Open MCM Menu and select a voice in the DBVO menu panel

Survival is fully integrated — not as a punishment, but as a way to slow down, breathe, and truly live in the handcrafted world. (Turn off survival by disabling survival mode improved if surival is not your thing) 

[🌍 A Living, Breathing Skyrim]

Dynamic world events — Thanks to SRC: Conquering of Skyrim, clearing a bandit fort means guards from the local hold will move in to reclaim it.
Persistent world changes — Solve the mystery of a burned-down house and watch it be rebuilt later. Clear a monster-infested mine and return to see the nearby town thriving again. See the scars of the Civil War slowly heal over time. 
Living relationships — Watch NPCs dynamically marry and move in together and be invited to their wedding if your current character happens to be friends! (Mod developed by yours truly.)
Seasons of Skyrim Integration — experience the world transform as winter arrives, draping the all holds in a stunning blanket of snow. 

[⚔️ Combat]

Vanilla Skyrim’s third-person combat suffers from “ice skating,” with attacks feeling weightless. True North replaces this with a grounded step & swing system using the latest and greatest combat framework BFCO. (In game, open bfco MCM menu to change POWER ATTACK key) First-person combat has also been fully overhauled with the same attention to detail. 

Combat is further elevated by four key combat overhauls:

Precision — brings true physics-based melee, realistic collisions, hit reactions, and weapon feedback.
Dismemberment Framework — adds real-time dismemberment, adaptive sound effects, and blood physics for visceral realism.
Sanguine Symphony — enhances impact and atmosphere with cinematic blood splatters, detailed decals, slow-motion finishers, and heavy hit feedback.
NPC Spell Variance — reworks NPC spell logic so mages use their full arsenal, including support, utility, and rune spells. No more mindless fireball spam — enemies now think, adapt, and fight with real strategy.

[👥 NPCs]

NPCs now live real lives. They follow routines, interact with the world, react to danger and the weather, and respond dynamically to events. Strangers won’t automatically greet you, families mourn the loss of loved ones, spouses move freely around town, and cities finally feel alive.
Visual overhauls bring NPCs to life with handpicked mods from the most talented creators, while preserving the rugged,  look appropriate for those living in skyrims harsh climate.

Every faction has been reimagined:

Madmen transforms the Forsworn, giving them a unique identity, shamanistic powers, and even rare werewolf transformations — a dramatic departure from the vanilla “antler bandits.”
The Restless Dead breathes new life into Skyrim’s undead, introducing diverse draugr, skeletons, and ghosts with unique tactics and visual variety. Every dungeon populated by the undead now offers new boss encounters.
Lawless overhauls bandits across Skyrim and Solstheim, adding new archetypes, scalable levels, and varied combat styles — ensuring every bandit encounter is challenging, dynamic, and immersive.

[📈 Performance]

True North delivers a next-gen experience without compromising performance. On a system with an NVIDIA RTX 4060 8GB and Intel i7-13700KF cpu, True North maintains 60 FPS across all areas, from dense cities to open wilderness. With experience as an SKSE developer, rest assured I’ve carefully optimized the modlist to provide smooth, stable gameplay even during large-scale battles and dynamic events. I suspect this to be one of the most FPS friendly lists of its size. 

Does not support widescreen, though I may add it. 

Requires steam version of the game probably I haven't tried with other game versions. 

[🏔️ Conclusion]

I made this modlist for myself, to play the modded version of Skyrim I’ve always dreamed of  — and now its available for everyone else.  

Im from northern Canada 🇨🇦 and skyrim reminds me of home. The northern lights especiialy which I can view form my front porch. 

The northern lights you see in this version of skyrim are as close as I can get to the real thing. 

Enjoy : )
