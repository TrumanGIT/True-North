# True-North

[üë∂ IMPORTANT INFO FOR NEW PLAYERS]

NO STOCK GAME FOLDER!
What does that mean?: 

It means you need to have a clean install of (GOG Version not tested) skyrim Anniversary Edition version 1.70 for steam. (CC content that came with AE is required) ready on your computer. 
A clean install means the game files haven‚Äôt been modified ‚Äî for example, no SKSE, Engine Fixes, or ENB files added. However, ESPs cleaned with SSEEdit are perfectly fine (and reccomended).
Steam version is prefferable The GOG version has not been tested and may not be work.

(wide screens can also redownload "DBVO" and "Lore-Friendly Load Screen Compendium (16-9) (2K)" mods and select the ultra wide options if they wish)

Recommended tweaks:

Survival Mode is enabled by default, which also disables fast travel. To compensate, Carriage Ferry Travel Overhaul and Road Signs Fast Travel 
are added‚Äîmore carriage drivers appear, and activating a road sign lets you fast travel to any town listed on it. (disable survival mode improved mod or visit the main menu game settings to turn off survival mode)

[True North]

True North is my vision of Skyrim ‚Äîa wabbajack list of 1000+ mods. A celebration of the Skyrim modding community‚Äôs incredible work over the last 14+ years.

[‚öíÔ∏è Modding, Simplified]

Modding Skyrim in 2025 is no easy task. To get the best possible experience, you need to master countless tools ‚Äî xEdit, DynDOLOD, xLODGen, Grass Cache, Creation Kit, Pandora, Synthesis, Wrye Bash, Bodyslide (the list goes on and on). Let me handle all of that for you.

The list automatically configures itself ‚Äî no manual setup is needed in game.

[üó∫Ô∏è The Vision]

True North stays faithful to Skyrim‚Äôs original design while enhancing it in every meaningful way.

Roleplaying is the heart of the experience. Alternate start lets you choose your own beggining and every notable questline has been altered to provide more roleplaying opportunitys. 

Experience your character fully voiced ‚Äî with both male and female voice options that bring every line, shout, and choice to life. (Open MCM Menu and select a voice in the DBVO menu panel

Survival is fully integrated ‚Äî not as a punishment, but as a way to slow down, breathe, and truly live in the handcrafted world. (Turn off survival by disabling survival mode improved if surival is not your thing) 

[üåç A Living, Breathing Skyrim]

Seasons of Skyrim Integration ‚Äî experience the world transform as winter arrives, draping the all holds in a stunning blanket of snow. 

Dynamic world events ‚Äî Thanks to SRC: Conquering of Skyrim, clearing a bandit fort means guards from the local hold will move in to reclaim it.

Persistent world changes ‚Äî Solve the mystery of a burned-down house and watch it be rebuilt later. Clear a monster-infested mine and return to see the nearby town thriving again. 

See the scars of the Civil War slowly heal over time. 

Living relationships ‚Äî Watch NPCs dynamically marry and move in together and be invited to their wedding if your current character happens to be friends! (Mod developed by yours truly.)

[‚öîÔ∏è Combat]

Vanilla Skyrim‚Äôs third-person combat suffers from ‚Äúice skating,‚Äù with attacks feeling weightless. True North replaces this with a grounded step & swing system using the latest and greatest combat framework BFCO. dodging and timed blocking has been added and First-person combat has also been fully overhauled with the same attention to detail. 

Combat is further elevated by four key combat overhauls:

Precision ‚Äî brings true physics-based melee, realistic collisions, hit reactions, and weapon feedback.

Dismemberment Framework ‚Äî adds real-time dismemberment, adaptive sound effects, and blood physics for visceral realism.

Sanguine Symphony ‚Äî enhances combat with with brutal visual effects like adaptive blood splatters, detailed decals, HD wound textures, and custom sound design.

NPC Spell Variance ‚Äî reworks NPC spell logic so mages use their full arsenal, including support, utility, and rune spells. No more mindless fireball spam ‚Äî enemies now think, adapt, and fight with real strategy.

[üìú Quests]

Every notable questline has been overhauled to provide more choice and freedom but here are some new quests/content you might want to check out:

‚ò†Ô∏è Olenveld

Link: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136788

[üë• NPCs]

NPCs now react to danger and the weather, and respond dynamically to events. Strangers won‚Äôt automatically greet you, and with my mod Love Is In The Air, NPCs can meet, fall in love, marry, move in together, and even invite you to their weddings if your friends ‚Äî adding real social life and emotion to Skyrim.

Visual overhauls bring every NPC to life with a new look thanks to a selection of appearence overhaul mods handpicked from the most talented creators, while preserving the rugged, look appropriate for those living in skyrims harsh climate.

Most vanilla npc followers have been greatly expanded with the "follower dialogue expansion" series to ensure using your old favourite followers feels fresh again. 

My favourite follower creater Craftian's followers can also be found in this list:

Celestine - A devout follower of stendarr found in front of the Jade Palace.

Nessa - A thief whos lost her arm during her last heist. She can be found in Rorikstead inn

Light and Shade - a blind travelling mercenary with a charming curiosity. She can be found in Whiterun Banneredmare inn. 

Every faction has been reimagined:

Madmen transforms the Forsworn, giving them a unique identity, shamanistic powers, and even rare werewolf transformations.

The Restless Dead breathes new life into Skyrim‚Äôs undead, introducing diverse draugr, skeletons, and ghosts with unique tactics and visual variety. Every dungeon populated by the undead now offers new boss encounters.

Lawless overhauls bandits across Skyrim and Solstheim, adding new archetypes, scalable levels, and varied combat styles ‚Äî ensuring every bandit encounter is challenging and fresh. 

Vigilants have been given ALOT of love with brand new equipment and a mod added allowing you to rebuild the hall of the vigilants afer its destroyed after level 10. (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49346)

Silverhand now has a new set of gear and is no longer hostile to the player for no reason. You can find out a bit of their story and might even become a honorary member. Silverhand will only become hostile if you join the Companions and become a werewolf.

[üìà Performance]

True North delivers a next-gen experience without compromising performance. On a system with an NVIDIA RTX 4060 8GB gpu and Intel i7-13700KF cpu, True North maintains 60 FPS across all areas. With experience as an SKSE developer, rest assured I‚Äôve carefully optimized the modlist to run smooth even on older machines. 

Should you still encounter fps drops, I reccomened disabling Community shaders and its add ones. Community shaders does the heavy lifting of the graphical improvements but comes at the cost of a sizeable performance impact. 

[üèîÔ∏è Conclusion]

Im from northern Canada üá®üá¶ and skyrim reminds me of home. The northern lights especiialy which I can view form my front porch. 

I made this modlist for myself, to play the modded version of Skyrim I‚Äôve always dreamed of  ‚Äî and now its available for everyone else.  

Enjoy : )
